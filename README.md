# Koding Global Virtual Hackathon's Submission

Yet Another Team (amitrott - Angelo Mitrotti)

Submission page

## Description

Motivation:
1. Practice coding skills
2. Learn new coding skills
3. Help people in some way
4. Have fun

This project addresses the need to have users read the TOS/EULA.

It accomplishes this by:
1. Splitting TOS into "slides"
2. Adding nice, basic animations
3. Allowing the user to read only a summary (at least, they will read something!)
4. If the user is intersted, and/or wants to access links, they can always check the full page

At this point, only manual summaries are possible:
modify 'populateTOS.php' to provide the URL and main container of the TOS/EULA.
